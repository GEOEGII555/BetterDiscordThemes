I have themes for BetterDiscord which I created collected here, right in this repository. [View my plugins](https://github.com/GEOEGII555/BetterDiscordPlugins)
# WhenLightModeIsNotEnough
Use this to prank your friends, especially if they are using Discord at night/hate light theme. Be careful! This is even lighter than the Discord's light theme!

[See how light it is (WARNING!)](https://github.com/GEOEGII555/BetterDiscordThemes/master/WhenLightModeIsNotEnough.png)
